Similar to [Flame for the Mac](http://jerakeen.org/code/flame/), this is a
Zeroconf service browser for the iPhone. I'll do metadiscovery of services
available on the local network, then find all machines with those services,
and group them by machine. Then it'll attempt to put a name to each computer,
preferably a human's name, a machine name otherwise.

It's in the early stages here, but I hope to get it onto the app store at some
point.
